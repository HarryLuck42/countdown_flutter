# Countdown App


### How to run the app
1. Open `Android Studio` or `Visual Studio Code`. But here, I'm using `Android Studio` to develop my flutter projects.
2. Wait until the project is opened. And then, open the terminal to clean and build your project. You do that for make sure the project doesn't have any errors.
3. Execute these syntax on the terminal 
```terminal
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter install
```
4. If there's no errors, you have to open `Android` or `iOS` simulator to run the project. You can open `iOS` simulator on `XCode` and for `Android` simulator you can open in `Android Studio` in `AVD Manager`.

5. After that, you can choose simulators or devices to run the project. And then, click green button play to run the project.

6. Wait until the running is successful. If the project can run successfully, the project will be showed on the simulators or the devices. Here's the example if the project has displayed on the simulators.
